##Digital Crafts Weather App

#How to run site: 

1. Clone Project from https://github.com/mzevitas/WeatherApp.git.
2. Run 'npm install' to install all the node modules.
3. I have built a compiler using grunt. Run 'grunt' to view application on localhost:8000.


The Gruntfile is running a watch on changes on all files, It will refresh the page on all saved changes.
